This is my TidalCycles sketchbook. I consider each of these files an ongoing improvisational piece, evolving slowly through time and space. Captures are not finished pieces, but glimpses into specific moments in the lifetime of said pieces.  
Feel free and encouraged to use this code for anything you want. Except harming dogs. Don't do that. Be excellent to dogs.
